        <p>as an effort to overcome my overthinking</p>

        <p>expose myself to uncomfortable new habits</p>

        <p>
            there is no reason not to really, if I happen to be too ashamed its
            only a `git commit` away to be disappear
        </p>

        <p>
            it can be any means of expression, the one that im more comfortable
            with at that point.

        <p>
            perceived effortless perfetion is actually a bunch of unknown
            practice
        </p>

        <p>
            sorry internet to dump you with more slop, at least this one is
            written with my monkey fingers, i promise all the practice will be
            worth it

i want to say what im going to do, while the expression itself is making the somehting that im going to do

i want to say why i want to do it. which is that i overthink and not expose myself and maybe i should do it more
    - perfection involves iteration
    - iteration involves exposure
    - exposure involves courage?

closing thought that i know what im pushing is not super high quality, but is a piece of myself.
the internet definetly doesnt need more slop, but it might need more authentic human generated content


about perfection. in the picasso musseum they just casually dropped that a guy gifted his collection of 1000s of picassos
( it wasnt just a guy, I know. it was his close asssistant) (there is 100s of thousands registered picassos, he was creating something all the time).
some may be great, some might not. but all were a part of the artist.


i mean the notes folder is literally just drafts i could post it as is
