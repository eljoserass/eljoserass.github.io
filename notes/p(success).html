            given that:</br>
            <ul>
                <li> the most likely thing to happen is that what you want or expect to happen, wont happen</li>
                <li> the most unlikely scenario is that the thing you expect to happen wont happen after infinite samples</li>
            </ul>
            i am not infinite, but i will try
        </p>

        <p> one must accept this two facts with grace. </p>

        <p> that is very likely (if not the most lilkely) to die forgotten, beaten and unachieved.</p>

        <p>
            during the travel, in each crossroad that one finds, the most likely thing to happen is that the path taken does not lead to where one wanted.
            if one accept this fate, will have a fresh mind to try to alter the odds with the minimal control one could have, which is being present in the travel,
            and learning from decisions amde when going through each crossroad.
        </p>

        <p>
            to accept this, one must know the reason why this travel is worth doing, hopefully a reason that will make everything else look miniscule.
            by doing this one is altering the chance, developing resilience, travelling for the sake of driving, without worrying if the destination will be reached.
        </p>

        <p>
            do not take me wrong, one must pursue greatness and kill oneself to reach the destination, but the only way is to accept that one must fail many times ebfore getting there.
            a source of hope, is accepting the second fact. if one samples infinite times looking for an event with a very low chance of occuring, the most likely thing is that the event will occur.
        </p>

        <p>
            each sample takes time, and one does not have infinite time, so the time given must be use at its full capacity, to turn the odds in our favor. not only by trying everything, but trying smartly,
            assuming risks based on hypotheses, and learning from the outcome.
        </p>

        <p>
            this is the only way.
        </p>

        <p>
            ultimatly with this perspective, the only way of dying bitter will be of not trying enough, rather than not getting to the destination.
