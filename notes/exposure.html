            I notice my writing style is simlar to what i've read, which is not
            super creative.

            two options, found a way to break my molds and dump more original text;
            or read new authors, more cultures, more genres. or both.

            although writing can be limitless, it takes a very good writer to do
            so. this actually apply to all forms of expression.

            writing has its rules and tools which you have to follow to
            consider it writing so to the uneducated (me) this can seem
            limiting, and that's why it takes a great writer to not be limted by
            it, it takes knowing the rules and the tools in order to bend them
            at their will and they no longer look like rules but maybe more
            like, fuel?
