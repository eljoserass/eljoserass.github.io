        <h1>talking to the void</h1>

        <p>
            if you ask me the reason why, i would tell you it doesnt matter
            really
        </p>

        <p>
            i have struggeled in the past with inaction due to doing too many
            passes over the question why, and not doing something unless the
            answer was clear.
        </p>

        <p>
            sometimes things just have to be done because your body is asking
            you to.
        </p>

        <p>
            curiosity, expression, testing your limits or just
            <strong>because</strong> are some good driving factors.
        </p>

        <p>
            its a balance of course, doing everything impulsively is definetly
            not good.
        </p>

        <p>
            how to now the difference has something to do with trusting your
            intuition, and having it to take peaces with your rationality.
        </p>

        <p>
            as an example, the post itself is me maybe
            overthinking/overjustifying the reason of posting these while no one
            is reading, but doing it anyway because somehting inside me is
            making me do so.
        </p>

        <p>
            it is soothing to accept that no one cares, no one will remember. i
            can simply let the thoughts flow, getting better one token at a
            time, getting used to sharing and documenting, on a platform I can
            delete-update anything I put out guilt-free
        </p>

        <p>
            there is some aspect of ego and self pleasure to it. i have to
            recognize what I feel and think as valuable enough to do something
            just because I want and what I want is important.
